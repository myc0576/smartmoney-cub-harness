"""Regression checks for the redesigned bilingual README visuals.

Verifies both READMEs reference the new cover and system flow assets, the
asset files exist with the expected PNG dimensions, both files contain a
language switch link, both carry the read-only contract, no merge markers
or absolute paths are leaked into the documentation set, and the asset
files do not exceed the Git-friendly size limit.
